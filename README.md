This is a Blackjack game with additional mathematical features. By skillfully using them, a player can increase their expected value of winning to be above the "house," as shown in the presentation.
The first function indicates the probability of getting a "bust" if another card is added.
The second function tells us the probability of winning if we choose the stand option.

To play, you need to run the file /BlackJack-PLAY/BlackJack.exe.
The application is in Polish.

Additional information:
The deck contains 52 cards. Shuffling occurs when there are fewer than 16 cards left.
The dealer must continue playing if they have less than 17. In the event of a tie in points, the dealer wins.
Blackjack occurs only when the player has 21 with the first two cards.
For aces, they are always counted in the most favorable way for the player and the dealer.
